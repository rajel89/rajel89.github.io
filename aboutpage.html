                <h3>My name is Rajah,</h3>
                <p>I am a “go getter” by nature passionate in making a difference personally and professionally.
                    I am proud military veteran turned professional Supply Planer for the manufacturing and retail
                    industry with over five years of experience managing a factory for a global brand.</p>

                <p>I take pride on the work I do and always aim to provide the best quality, highest level of
                    efficiency, saving cost, and increasing sales.</p>

                <p>I like to innovate to keep up with the changes in the industry. I have been providing supply chain
                    consultation services for small ecommerce and manufacturing business around the globe.</p>

                <p>On the personal side of things. I like to start my day tending to my vegetable garden,
                    and mow the lawn keeping low cut and very green. Every once in awhile, I like to enjoy
                    a cold bottle of beer or sip on a glass of whiskey and listen
                    to classical music to help my mind at ease.</p>
